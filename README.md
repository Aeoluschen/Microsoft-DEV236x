:snake: Introduction to Python: Absolute Beginner. 

In this course, I learned about basic Python syntax and operations (types, variables, string formatting, etc.) Also, I learned about functions, conditionals, and nesting and loops. This was a great introduction of the Python language. After having completed the course, I am more comfortable with the natural use of the language. By working the problem sets, I have gained greater logical thinking. One thing I still struggle with is the different parts of a function; I am having struggles understanding parameters within function and returning from a function. I look forward to taking the next course in the Microsoft series, and maybe I will have a chance to work with functions again.
